# Advanced_Line_Follower_Robot_Using_LDR
This robot uses advanced line following algorithm (written using Embedded C); it can trace straight line, obtuse turns, right turns, acute turns and can detect perpendicular junctions. It can also detect obstacles and stop at a safe distance. It also detects caves and reduces its speed when inside one.  The robot won 1st place in the competition held during Kaizen Robotics Program.
