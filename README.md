# Advanced Line Follower Robot Using LDR
This robot is driven by ATmega16 and uses advanced line following algorithm (written using Embedded C); it can trace straight line, obtuse turns, right turns, acute turns and can detect perpendicular junctions. It can also detect obstacles and stop at a safe distance. It also detects caves (using LDR) and reduces its speed when inside one.
